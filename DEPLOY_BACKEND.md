# üöÄ DEPLOY BACKEND NOW

## Current Issue
The backend has updated CORS settings but **hasn't been redeployed on Render yet**.

## Solution - Deploy Backend on Render (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Render Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com/
2. **Sign in** with your account
3. **Find** your backend service (should be named `vybe-backend` or similar)
4. **Click** on the service
5. **Click** "Manual Deploy" button (top right)
6. **Select** "Deploy latest commit"
7. **Wait** 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Automatic Deploy
If you have auto-deploy enabled, just wait 5 minutes for Render to automatically detect the GitHub push.

## ‚úÖ How to Verify It's Fixed
After deployment completes:
1. Visit: https://vybe-backend-93eu.onrender.com/api/health
2. Should see: `{"status":"ok","message":"VYBE API is running"}`
3. Your website will load products correctly!

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Backend code updated with proper CORS
- ‚úÖ Frontend code updated with correct backend URL
- ‚úÖ All code pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ **WAITING:** Backend deployment on Render
- ‚è≥ **WAITING:** Vercel frontend redeployment (auto)

## What the Fix Does
- Allows ALL `.vercel.app` domains (including preview deployments)
- Properly handles CORS credentials for authentication
- Supports cookies for login/sessions
