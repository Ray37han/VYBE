# ðŸš€ QUICK FIX - Enable Network Upload

## The Problem
Windows/Android users see "Cannot connect to server" when uploading products.

## The Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Frontend Config
Open `client/.env` and change:
```env
# FROM THIS:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api

# TO THIS (use your Mac's IP):
VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.0.209:5001/api
```

### Step 2: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## Access from Windows/Android
Open browser and go to:
```
http://192.168.0.209:3000
```
(NOT localhost:3000!)
